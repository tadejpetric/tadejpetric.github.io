            <h2>Sequential Parallelism, part 1</h2>
            <p><em>Posted on January 31, 2025</em></p>

            <p>
                Recently, I've been reading a bit on various computer architectures and stumbled upon <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicitly_parallel_instruction_computing">EPIC</a>. One of the
                most famous representatives of the EPIC paradigm is the Intel's Itanium processor family. The
                architecture seems to be mostly dead by now; they haven't made any new processors since 2017, Linux
                dropped support for the architecture and HP, the partner for the IA64 development, is dropping its
                support for the architecture in 2025. These processors were based on the IA64 instruction set rather
                than the x86 that most of us use today. In fact, it was probably created <emph>to be incompatible
                </emph> with x86, so they wouldn't have to share the license with AMD. Of course, a fresh start allows
                you to try some new things, so they experimented a bit. Most prominent feature in the architecture is
                the insane amount of registers. The 32-bit x86 processors have only 8 general purpose registers, x86-64
                has 16, most RISC processors these days have 31 (register 0 being hardwired to 0, hence the odd number).
                Itanium, however, has 128 general purpose registers. And an additional 128 floating point registers. Why
                that would be useful is the topic of this blog post. Because no one (including me) is using Itanium
                processors, we'll be exploring all of those advantages in x86-64 and use the ideas to make programs that
                are faster than what C compilers can generate.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem statement</h3>
            <p>
                We'll be looking at a minimal example, a simple sum of numbers. Because the computers these days are a
                bit quick, we'll be summing up 2GB worth of numbers 10 times. Let's first look at the code in C.
            </p>
            <pre>
<code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#define array_size 500000000

static unsigned int array[array_size]; // Static so it doesn't annihilate the stack

void set_array(unsigned int *array) {
    // Element i gets value i
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < array_size; i++) {
        array[i] = i;
    }
}

int sum_elements(unsigned int *array) {
    // Return sum of all elements, ignoring all overflows
    unsigned int sum = 0;
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < array_size; i++) {
        sum += array[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    set_array(array);
    // Volatile to prevent compiler from removing function calls
    volatile int sum = 0; 
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        sum += sum_elements(array);
    }
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <p>So we're summing 500 million elements 10 times, each element 32 bits long. The code itself is pretty
                simple, we're just looping over the array and adding up one value at a time. Let's compile it and
                benchmark the performance. We'll be compiling with GCC, but for now we'll be disabling SIMD (single
                instruction multiple data) registers
                and instructions. They don't really change anything, just the code gets more complicated to talk about.
                We might add them back in the future, however (spoilers: there's part 1 in the title).</p>
            <p>The command we'll be using to compile the program is</p>
            <pre>gcc sum_c.c -O0 -mno-avx -mno-mmx -mno-sse -mno-sse2</pre>
            <p>Of course we'll look at the performance with higher optimization settings as well. The numbers in the
                table are an average runtime of 10 executions of the program.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>O0</th>
                    <th>O1</th>
                    <th>O2</th>
                    <th>O3</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>8.8834</td>
                    <td>1.5924</td>
                    <td>1.619</td>
                    <td>1.7643</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>As expected, the least optimised setting O0 is the slowest. If we look at the generated assembly code, we
                can see that it's quite odd. Due to the length of the generated assembly I am only providing the
                relevant part, the loop of the sum_elements. I will be providing comments with the code and, since
                assembly is a bit esoteric these days, an explanation of the code. And to make it even easier, let's
                take a look at the basics of assembly as briefly as possible. If you already know the basics, skip ahead
                to the next chapter.</p>
            <h4>Assembly prerequisites</h4>
            <p>Assembly has several registers, that behave similar to local variables in C. There is only a limited
                amount of registers, if you need to store more variables you have to push them to the memory on the
                stack. The most well known registers are <code class="language-x86asm">rax</code>, <code
                    class="language-x86asm">rbx</code>, <code class="language-x86asm">rcx</code> and <code
                    class="language-x86asm">rdx</code>. These are general purpose registers, so you can use them for
                anything you want (though in practice they usually have dedicated roles, which you need to obey if
                you're making your code compliant with code of other people) (some instructions which we won't use are
                also limited to only certain registers). There is also the register <code
                    class="language-x86asm">rbp</code>, which stores the location in the stack with the latest element
                pushed to the stack (<emph>technically</emph> it's also a general purpose regis- I will be ignoring any
                exceptions from now on, there's too many of them). </p>
            <p>
                All of the listed registers are 64-bit. We can only take the first 32 bits by writing <code
                    class="language-x86asm">eax</code> instead of <code class="language-x86asm">rax</code> (and
                similarly an e prefix instead of r for other registers). We can do operations on the registers. The
                simplest one is <code class="language-x86asm">mov</code>, which acts sort of like the assignment
                operator in C. So the equivalent of the C code
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">int x = 0;
int y = x;
</code></pre>
            would be
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">mov eax, 0
mov ebx, eax 
</code></pre>
            We can add a number using the instruction <code class="language-x86asm">add</code>. Again, let's look at the
            C equivalent.
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">int x = 0;
y += x;
</code></pre>
            And the assembly version.
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">mov eax, 0
add ebx, eax 
</code></pre>
            We also need to calculate the addresses of certain elements. This can be done with <code
                class="language-x86asm">add</code> just fine, but x86 has a neat shorthand in form of <code
                class="language-x86asm">lea</code> (which stands for load effective address). There is no exact C
            equivalent, but the following code behaves the same in practice
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">int x = 0;
int* y = &x[5];
</code></pre>
            And the assembly version, where the semicolon denotes the comment.
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">mov eax, 0
lea ebx, [eax + 20] ; 5*4 = 20
</code></pre>
            Since we used 32-bit registers, we need to move forward 4 bytes at a time (hence why we multiply 5 with 4,
            which will be a common theme). Had we used 64-bit registers, that constant would be 8.

            The final instructions we need are branches. We can compare two registers and then jump to a label depending
            on the result. The C equivalent would be if statements and goto statements, but this one is pretty self
            explanatory so let's look at the assembly code only. The instruction <code
                class="language-x86asm">nop</code> does nothing.
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">cmp eax, ebx ; compare
jl eax_is_less_than_ebx ; jump if less 
je eax_is_equal_to_ebx ; jump if equal
; jbe = jump if below or equal
...
eax_is_less_than_ebx:
    nop ; executed if eax &lt; ebx
    jmp endcmp ; jump unconditionally
eax_is_equal_to_ebx:
    nop ; executed if eax = ebx
    jmp endcmp
endcmp:
    nop ; after branches, code continues here
</code></pre>
            We are now equipped to examine the GCC code.
            </p>
            <h4>GCC generated assembly</h4>
            <p>The following code was generated by GCC with -O0 flag. On the stack at location <code
                    class="language-x86asm">rbp-4</code> we store the loop variable i and, again on the stack, at
                location <code class="language-x86asm">rbp-8</code> we store the value of the partial sum and at the
                value <code class="language-x86asm">rbp-24</code> we store the address of the start of the array of all
                numbers.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">.L6:
	mov	eax, DWORD PTR -4[rbp] ; read value of i into register eax (eax = i)
	lea	rdx, 0[0+rax*4] ; calculate which element from the array we want to read (rdx = 4*i)
	mov	rax, QWORD PTR -24[rbp] ; read the address of the start of the array (rax = array)
	add	rax, rdx ; rax = &array[i]
	mov	eax, DWORD PTR [rax] ; eax = *(eax) (equivalent to = array[i])
	add	DWORD PTR -8[rbp], eax ; partial_sum += eax (or partial_sum += array[i])
	add	DWORD PTR -4[rbp], 1 ; increment i += 1
.L5:
	cmp	DWORD PTR -4[rbp], 499999999 ; check if loop is over
	jbe	.L6</code></pre>
            <p>We're ignoring the mess that happens because it's sometimes using 32-bit values and sometimes 64-bit
                values. If all the instructions take the same amount of time, we can see that it spends most of its time
                doing busywork. It takes 5 instructions to just read the element we want to add and only one instruction
                actually adding the element. This is what -O1, -O2 and -O3 improve. Curiously, -O3 is the slowest of
                them all and -O1 fastest, but the reasons for that aren't all that relevant for this blog post. We'll
                look at the assembly code for -O3.</p>

            <p>The code using the -O3 flag is much simpler. It's now not using the stack at all, it's only storing the
                variables. The register <code class="language-x86asm">rdi</code> initially stores the start of the
                array, while
                the register <code class="language-x86asm">rdx</code> stores the end of the array (or rather one element
                past the end). The register <code class="language-x86asm">eax</code> stores partial sums.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">.L13:
    add	eax, DWORD PTR [rdi] ; eax += *ptr (or += array[i])
    add	rdi, 4 ; ptr++ (or i++)
    cmp	rdx, rdi ; if we're not at the end of the array yet
    jne	.L13</code></pre>

            This code seems much simpler and it looks about as simple as you can get. After all, we're always going to
            need
            to add the number for the partial sum. And we're always going to need to increment the pointer. And we're
            always
            going to need to compare whether we're finished yet. So there's no hope for improvement... But first, let's
            rewrite the entire program in assembly by ourselves. If we do that, the code becomes readable and short.
            We'll
            show that this doesn't meaningfully affect the performance.
            <h3>Rewriting code ourselves</h3>
            <p>I have written the program in x86 assembly from scratch, so that the results are easily reproducible
                elsewhere. I'll first paste the entire program</p>
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">GLOBAL main

        jge endsetloop
        mov [array + 4*eax], eax ; array[eax] = eax
        inc eax ; eax++

    endsetloop:

        pop rax
        inc rax
        jmp startmainloop
    endmainloop:
    
    xor eax, eax
    ret
</code></pre>
            <p>The interesting function, and the one we're going to change, is sum_array. We're only going to be
                changing that one, so let's look at it more closely</p>
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">sum_array:
    xor eax, eax ; partial sum carrier
    xor ecx, ecx ; array index

    startsumloop:

        jge endsumloop
        add eax, [array + 4*rcx] ; eax += array[rcx]
        inc rcx ; rcx++
        jmp startsumloop
    endsumloop:
    ret</code></pre>
            <p>Let's examine the runtime. If I run the program 10 times, the average runtime is 1.6376s. This is quite
                close to the GCC generated code. A bit slower than -O1, a bit faster than -O3, but nothing special.
                Let's now do a trick that shouldn't change much. Instead of adding only one element at a time, we'll add
                two elements per iteration of a loop. This should eliminate half of the branch checks, so the program is
                more efficient, but due to <a
                    href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array">branch
                    prediction</a>, this doesn't actually change all that much. Only one out of 500M elements is
                actually choosing a different path of the branch, so the branch predictor quickly learns to optimize
                that. Still, let's write out the code and benchmark it out, just to be sure (note that the code is only
                valid if there's an even number of elements, but we don't care).</p>
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">set_array:
    xor eax, eax ; array index

    startsetloop:
        cmp rcx, array_len
        jge endsetloop
        add eax, [array + rcx*4] ; eax += array[rcx]
        add eax, [array + rcx*4 + 4] ; eax += array[rcx+1]
        add rcx, 2 ; rcx += 2
        jmp startsetloop
    endsetloop:
    ret</code></pre>
            <p>As we can see, now each iteration of the loop we're adding twice to eax. We measure the average time to
                be 1.6061s, which is an improvement, but it's so small that we can't even be sure if it's due to fewer
                branches or just random chance - for reference, the times vary by up to 0.03s within these 10 runs. Now
                let's make a sneaky improvement: instead of adding twice to <code class="language-x86asm">eax</code>,
                let's add once to <code class="language-x86asm">eax</code> and the other time to <code
                    class="language-x86asm">ebx</code>. At the end, just add the two together to get the final result.
                Because addition (even modular) is commutative, this will, of course, still work.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">sum_array:
    xor eax, eax ; partial sum carrier
    xor ebx, ebx ; partial sum carrier 2
    xor rcx, rcx ; array index

    startsumloop:
        cmp rcx, array_len
        jge endsumloop
        add eax, [array + 4*rcx] ; eax += array[rcx]
        add ebx, [array + rcx*4 + 4] ; ebx += array[rcx+1]
        add rcx, 2 ; rcx += 2
        jmp startsumloop
    endsumloop:
    add eax, ebx ; eax += ebx
    ret</code></pre>
            <p>And by now you know the drill, run it 10 times and check the benchmarks. We barely changed anything and
                assembly should just run one instruction at a time anyway, so this shouldn't make a difference. So I
                compute the average and it's again one point si- huh, 1.3386s. What is going on here.</p>
            <h3>Instruction level parallelism</h3>
            <p>What's happened is that we've accidentally created a program that runs in parallel. We've never created a
                new thread, we've never created a new process, we haven't even used any SIMD instructions. But the two
                add instructions</p>
            <pre><code class="language-x86asm">add eax, [array + 4*rcx] ; eax += array[rcx]
add ebx, [array + rcx*4 + 4] ; ebx += array[rcx+1]

            <p>still ran simultaneously. Modern processors have a special mechanism where they attempt to execute the
                next instruction even if the one beforehand isn't finished. If the computation of the next instruction
                requires the result of the previous one (such as when we were adding to the same register twice), the
                second instruction will wait until it receives the result. However if the two instructions are
                completely independent, both of them can proceed at the same time. And since we weren't writing to the
                memory that the second register reads from, nor was that register already occupied before, there is
                nothing stopping us from executing both instructions at the same time - assuming of course, the hardware
                supports that. The x86 architecture processors support that since around 1995, with the first such
                processor being the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_(original)">Pentium</a>. So
                this is how we can write parallel code in a sequential program. A bit of an oxymoron, but it's
                justified.</p>
            <p>Of course that isn't the only such instance of parallelism in modern processors - we've even sneakily
                mentioned one before in this blog post, branch prediction (and the related speculative execution).
                During a branch prediction, the processor guesses which path a branch will take (the "if" or the "else"
                path of an if statement, for example). Then it goes and starts executing one. However the computer can't
                just work on a guess, it still has to go and check whether it selected the correct branch; it's just
                that it can go and check that while it's executing one of the paths (some architectures, especially
                GPU-based ones like executing both paths without guessing). Then once it's determined whether the branch
                selection is correct, if it's correct it continues executing and if not, scraps it and starts the other
                option from the beginning. Even if it's incorrect it's not that tragic - it has to reverse the work done
                to some registers so it can be slower than just waiting for the result of the branch before proceeding,
                but ignoring that; in the worst case with branch prediction it has to restart at the beginning once the
                result is known, while even in the best case without branch prediction, it has to start at the beginning
                once the result is known. So if the "rollback" is fast enough, we get a massive improvement</p>
            <p>There is also something related these processors can do with independent operations, they can arbitrarily
                swap their order of execution. So we can't even be sure whether our <code
                    class="language-x86asm">eax</code> got added first or if, somehow, the data was available sooner for
                <code class="language-x86asm">ebx</code> and that one began the execution first. That's known as out of
                order execution. So even though our assembly looks close to hardware and sequential, often, as we have
                seen, what happens in the machine isn't exactly what our sequential code appears to dictate.</p>
