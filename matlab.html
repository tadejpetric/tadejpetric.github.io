<h1>Matlab is the worst language</h1>
        This is an ongoing effort to describe my hate for MATLAB. Enjoy
<h2>Things I hate</h2>
<h3>Array access uses the same syntax as function evaluation</h3>
<p>Consider <code>f = @(x) = x</code>. What does <code>f(end)</code> do? (Note, this is Matlab specific, Octave doesn't allow it).</p>
<h3>Functions of multiple return variables are a mess</h3>
<h2>Things I dislike (that don't make the language bad by itself)</h2>
