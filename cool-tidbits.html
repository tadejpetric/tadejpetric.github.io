    <h2>Cool tidbits</h2>
    A tidbit is a small treat. Here I'll be posting posts written by me that are too short to be considered an article,
    but they're still interesting enough to be shared. Some of them are things I recently learned about, some are things
    I've noticed others don't know, and some are just plain interesting.
